# Medical Cost Prediction 


## Problem Statement
A health insurance company has its customers spread in various zones all over the country. It maintains a voluminous data on the basis of which it decides the medical expenditure cost of all its customers. However, it is difficult to manually calculate the cost for each customer. Hence, a predictive model is required.

## Tools and Dataset

We have proposed to predict the insurance for new customers based on the dataset of the previous customers of the company. This will help customers get an idea on how much cost they can expect before applying for insurance, ensuring that they can make informed decisions as well as benefit the company by only connecting with customers that can afford their packages. 

### Libraries Used : 

The tools and dataset used in our prediction model are as follows:
#### Language: Python

#### Tools:
  - Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Seaborn and Matplotlib: Employed for data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn (sklearn): A machine learning library in Python.

### Dataset:
- insurance.csv: The dataset you used for training and testing your prediction model.
This combination of tools and dataset suggests a well-rounded approach, incorporating data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques.
